# About 
This app I co-developed in the jonas.io course. A React app that allows travellers to add items they need for their next trip The app will display the items that are added and packed and have a sort by option. We will have a footer that displays the number of items on the list, the number of items that have been packed, and the percentage of items that have been packed. If there are no items in the list, the component will display a message asking the user to add some items. 

# Features
- Add Items: Easily add items to your packing list using the user-friendly interface.
- Delete Items: Remove unwanted items from your list with just a click of a button.
- Checkboxes: Mark items as packed by checking off the corresponding checkboxes.
- Bulk Delete: Delete all items from your list at once for a fresh start.
- Sort List: Sort your packing list based on description or packed status.
